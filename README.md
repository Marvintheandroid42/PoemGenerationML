## Final Generated Shakespeare Sonnet:

But that I speak thee, nor myself, I say.

Your dicipline in war, wisdom in place; 

Whilst you have fed upon my servant may 

No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech your grace 



To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight; 

How, Phility, hould live, or else a pair 

I am the drudge and toil in your delight, 

Show me a mistress that is passing fair, 



That you do speak to them, nor who is now. 

How say you sing at once chafed, he cannot 

I must confess your offer is the bow;

But for my sister, and I think it not


Your father's image is so hit in you, 

He shor holds and friends: he was ever too
