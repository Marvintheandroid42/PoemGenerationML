Paradise --

How many times it ache for me -- today -- Confess --
He it away
Life's Opportunity --

The Things that Death will buy
Are Room --
Escape from Circumstance --
Lambs for whom time will come
Hinder it a little
When the Corn in Silk will dress
And in Chintz the Brave Beloved --

Fraud of Distance -- Fraud of Danger,
Fraud of Death -- to bear --
It is Bebring round the pards -- lips as her work --
Her needle would not go --
What ailed so smart a ling --
It patient -- like a pain --
Fresh gilded make a visther en --
My flowers raise their pretty laid home --
Just so far -- goes away --

Oh, Signor, The And so and so -- had been to me,
Had God will find it bight
Jowe so fal far -- today --

Whose Buts of Seas --
Unvisited of Shores --
Themse behind --
I felt his Silver Wores --
Her Extremend of the Round --

It Moon -- ild fashioned Miracle
When Summerting now --
Its Children sleep --

A nxed of thee --
Can be no Bode of Dawn
It can't be "Summer"!
That -- got through!
It's early -- yet -- for "Spring unmove the ow donriage uffect --
But what must be a me
How far -- the Gentleman
In the "White Robe" --
And they -- were the little Hand -- e'tire us --
Than whatever Broad, and God -- I neither knew
Yet Both so well knew me
Neater Eye --
Nature was in an Opal Awell stile
That little Yellow boys and girls
Were climbing all the while --
Till when they reacheder than new -- could be -- for that --
Thow bany must my music!
Bubble!  Bubble!
How mean the Oorself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June.

Today is far from Childhood --
But up and down the hissed
"Of me"?
"No cordiality" --
He fathomed me --
The Trees like Tassels -- hit -- and swung --
The Butterfly's Numidian Gown
With spots of Burnish roasted on
Is proof against the Fete away --
Summer has two Begins its avarice
A meditation chastens

of Her Veright mean --

Of Priests -- adjust the Symbols --
When Sacrament -- is done --
Summer for thee, grant affection!
Why Fath the Anguish Bells seem in summer
Or Bees, at Christmas show --
So fairy -- soft Confides

And so of larger -- Darkness --
Those Evenings of the Brain --
When not a Moon disclose a sign --
The partes with a Ruby --
Lathed -- with Down --

Stiller miss --
The Butterfly upon the Sky,
That doesn't know its Name
But that they havide --
With which flowers humble men:
Anybody find the fountain
As even in the sky --

I'm confident that Bravoes --
Perpetual break abroad,
And you good jat stay.
A lt"hest -- to adore --
'Tis One by One -- there --

The wrtting had Death --
The Lord -- and Thee --

Departing then -- forever --
Forever -- until May --
Forever is deciduous
Except to those that such were for the Years
That knows howaut a new
Upon a Wheel of Cloud.
I rose -- because He sank --
I thought it would be a pain
Except for Holiness then --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lone.
Except to something spe
A mighty look runs rt --
But what must be the smile
Upon Her Friend she could confer
Were such Her Silver Will --

And if His Yellow feet should deem superfluous
Make Death and Theed
Sech ears
For newness of the night --
Then -- fit our Vision to the Dark --
And me -- the Guch -- Garase he -- litter back --
She rose and fell the magic Plances --
She rose as high as His Occasion
Then sought the Dund --
Lithoo effect --
A Ruffle -- or a Tune --

The Afternoons -- Togtle Infinite --

'Tis failure -- not of Hope --
But Confident Despair --
Advancing on Celestial make a Dent thendyoor a Species
As positively live

As I, who testify it
Deny that I -- am dead --
And film my Lufe opposition --
And now, by Life deprived,
In my own Grave I breathe
And estimate its size --
Its since is excepting pass
That inolsibize at length, the Grave --
To thate had but my summer Day
For newnoonty -- to Suspense's
Vague Calamity --

Stalking our entire Possession
On a Hair's result --
The Traveller eith a glass,
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lared to exhere Exterely --
At the Meridian
Is 'twas a meaner size --
Then I had counted it until
Itself make a Prapt --
Beauty -- be not caused -- It I see Thee best --
Itself of joy
Is shorter than the first.
The truth I do not dare to know
I muffle wits the waters prink --
The Mound are the Trees --

But Tat their nest --
Makes a Deluge --
And swept the World away --
But Ararat's a Legend -- now --
And no one credits Noahen hurrid Way --
Whose Memory drowns me, like the Dip
Of a Celestial Sea --

What Mornings in our Garden --
But what that Place could be --
Afflicts me -- as a Set --
To a Curcumat E at me -- and stare --

I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little gimlle in the land --
Surrendering -- the last --
Nor even of Damn --
It vather -- suppans a Deluge --
And swept the World away --
But Ararat's a Legend -- now --
And no one credits Noahen I have entered theseowme was to know --

Till opposite -- I spied a cheek
That bore another Rose --
Just opposite -- Another soul --

All crumpled was the cheek
No other kiss had known
Than flake of snow, divided with
The Favorite of Doom.

When it has just contained -- it! Band --

Distracts least they would disient the Hume --
And every sign before the Place
Is Gilt with Sacrifice --
Like Rain it sounded till
But the Heart withdraws --

"I will give" the base Proviso --
Spare Your "Crown of Life" --
The Large -- untied their Boyn --

Maddest Heart that God created
Cannot move a sod
Pasted by the simple summer
On the Longe --

And notwithstand be behold a Box --
I shall not feel at Home -- I know --
I don't like Paradise --

Because it's recollected of the man
The sacred stealth of Bay --
To be a Flower, is plunder in the Brade --
That -- is Asternoon
A bird dow's Title Deed --
Henceforth, a Dedicated sort --
Yet Moth I had -- careded --
But what must be the morn --
Such an on --

How many cast a nameless Pod
I dend my spice fail for me --
The Rivet in the Bands
Who has not found the Heaven -- below --
Will fail of it ad a Foe will be beating -- till I thought
My Mind was wooking opp
A thought that you ime --
Spect out scarcely setes
Were be a Faith --
Did he find its Carne --
Deposed -- distrlose Defiant of a Road --
The Star's Etruscan Argument
Substantiat the door ajar!
I say, As if the cloud,
If any Power behind it, be,
Not subjects that it is gone
Are ignorant of its Concern
As if it were on its snow
Than Enotfhest of the Rain
In his new white House of Road
Till Book's abote impetus of Goal --
There is no Diligence like that
That knows not an Until --
The fascinating child the Pearls --
What Nature sent to me
At Sumerfood -- ceased by Death --

When it had pushed itself away
Limerding her Bees --
She slept as for myself dote sdace
That leads away from thee --
No circuit saggleen -- Cantions --
Muspless were wed one summer -- dear --
Your Vision -- was in June --
And when Your little Lifetime failed, may have judged,
And left the little Angle Worm
With Modesties enlarged.
Through those who pray
Horizons -- must ascend --
And so I stepped upon the North
To see this Curious Faces --

Let me no odesp wather
Leads the Chosen Fleed,
And My -- deliring -- indend --
Unknown becometh me --
I'll dwell in Calyx -- Gray --
How modestly -- alway --
Thy Daisy --
Draped for thee, to drink
And perhaps a pang of jound
It happy an harass me no more --
An Antiquest Plains --

And still her hum
The years had an ey the Feet --
You guesseeder eyes will say
Are paltry melody
Slike Squirrels, ran --
The Hills untied their Bonnets --
The Bobolinks -- began --
The Hears was no Foot --
An Overtook Couted Ban --
The Lord a Candle entertains
For evort
One Sister have I in our house,
And one, a hedge away.
There's only one recorded,
But both belong away
Now I knew I recolle cose --
The Farthest -- unsurely every Door --

Its Past -- set down before the Soul
And lighted with a Match --
Perusal -- to facieration --
Restraining Rampant Squirrel --
Om to immortal trundend -- lulled --
Then Sunrise kissed my Chrysaling Cheer
As no One --
And though thought a defarver Nature's root
Whose unvitation, too.

What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now --
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief mand stood it patent --
Gush after Gush, reserved for you --
Scarlet Experiment!  Sceptic Thonormur Nagures
Proppetite Music --
Beloved only Afternoon
That Prison doen The Second --

Maddest Heart that God called must me -- dut on for Glee --
But all manks a Dell at me -- and stare --

I had not spiner fail in Nature -- so suffice us
The enchantless Pod --
While Oceans have to You touch
The Eyes of an hour more!
I cannot meet the Spring unmoved --
I feel the old desire --
A Hurry with a lingering Breath
In timid and tumultuous soil
A finer -- each years -- leapt you -- Paradise --
Our dizzy urtimates the finerest want --
It was ucallation Ourself
As we evho stand affection!
When they dislocate my Brain!
Amputate my freckled Bosom!
Make me bearded like a man!
From Vistance -- be Summer -- eventually.
Ladies -- with parasols --
Sauntering Gentlemen -- with Canes --
And little Year -- low before the Door
Aredred what we know --

And so with Thews of Hymn --
And Sinew from within Her like Ben, like a Rose -- away --
Upon Vermilion Wheels --
Floss won't save you from an Abyss
But a Rope was notched --
As Floods --
The Butterfly in honored Dust
Assuredly will lie
But happy lie disclosed to us
The clamor for their loveliness
Would burst the Loneliness --
As the Starved Materning Be Mornets flag --
But were no one
Farther than you --
Do you think I'd spling remove
With that old Codicil of Doubt?
I cannot help esteem --

Leaving on the Conjerare Dy --
'Tis Act --
And later -- when we difference is as big
As Liquor at the Lip between
And Liquor in the Jug
The latter -- excellent the Handsome Skies
I shall not feel at Home -- I know --
I don't like Paradise --

Because it barsnapting -- leanisted --
For Ornith -- last Decain --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except to some wide -- and my Belt --
And past my Bodice -- --

'Tis Worms lt -- no later -- Sweet --
Then -- the License closes --

Some such Spice -- express and pass --
She dances like a Boment alm was scandow --

If I believed God looked around,
Each time my Childish eye
Fixed -- naugebor thee to dls Delight
The Lead my awkward -- gains out of his Covert
As one staredend you -- Delight
Like Separation's Swell
Restored in Arctic Confidence --
Somewhat of nods and somewhat
Portentous inference.

The indive Guineat
Of the unture the door ajar!
Expanse cannot be lost --
Not Joy, but a Decree
Is Deity --
His Scene, Infinity --

And often since, in Dalk theenown.
The Winters are so short --
I'm hardly justified
In sending all the Birds away --
And movits rlood --
Believes all sham
But Paradise --

Credits the World --
Deems His Dominion
Broadest of SovoThat Ordination -- utters --

My Business, with the Cloud,
If ary pult at Door --

Its Past -- seprief --

But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sigh --
My Cwamor -- excellent rose --

Her pretty speech Recollect it -- as well --

Not swill rears the Curple Day
Is Death -- the first -- to hand the sting
That winter to a Hindered Flags -- Sweet hoisted --
With Spices -- in the Hem --

'ar offend so and so -- had been to me,
Had God with fatalss just a bit of "Crown" --
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home --

I'me -- by diaded up --
But what must be the smile
Upon Her Friend she could confer
Were such Her Summt, that suddennoo-
As if it held but the mids a Tree --
Bot any House the Flowers keepep
That Earliar in the Trundle bed
How many I espy
Whose Nightgowns could not hide the Winds --
Although s
In a mystery --

I s adfligation
Discloses just a Hue --
A plash of Oars, a Gassion was --
In E Warg --
Long Dungeoned from his Rose --
Touch Liberty -- then knocled -- now --
And that -- a further -- and the Three
But a presumption be --

Of Periods -- and All --
But there'stoolisher effect --
A Ruffle -- or a Tune --

The Afternoons -- Together spent --
And Twilight -- I knew --

Maddest Heart was darker than tudned -- naught -- everything --
Over the stile of "Pearl."
A Wind that rose
Though not a Leaf
I had paid so much for --
His is Penury
Who hath suffered him --
I watched the Moon around the House
Until upon a Pandace pain --
From winter ry -- the boldest stole out of his Covert
To Neighbors doubtless he at me --

If God could make a visit --
Or ever took a Nap --
So not to see us -- but they came --
What a Cell!
Lethe Sepulchre
Don't for just how Red --
And dark Your Paradise --

I've Way -- and I --
Appareled would see a Spheres" -- klow --

And partakes -- his Tongue

Cooled by the Morse of Maly the Noes --
Prickled entirely -- between --
The Mind sufficient be --
Those fair -- Vit one --

Time is a Test of Trouble --
But not a Memad 'twe first
Was full --

This -- was my finallest Occasion --
But then
My tenderer Experiment
Toway -- as a starvant --
Remotest -- when 'twas Wort --
n say that in the Corner dwells
Her martial Day forgot
The more their Feet retire.

Whose rumor's Gate was shut so tight
Before my Beam was sown,
Not even a Prognostic's push
Could opernoon -- and my flowers for thee --
Bright Absentee!
My Future's insmen ear
The distant strains of triumph
Burst agonized and clear!
I'm In -- not berry --
Spl --

How many cast a nameless Pod
Upon the nearest Breeze --
Unconscious of the Scarlet Freight was not -- no figpetime invention --
Her Golden finger on Her lip --
Oh Future!  the Children sleep --
She turns as long away
As will suffice to light Her lamps --

And all when the Hills decay --
My Father -- like a pain --
Fresh gilded --

All crumpled was the comest --
Her Do-
Minute Effulgencies and Winds --
When what they to do with us
And when portentost -- and Nowbing -- to liss it --
Denity cannot recollect
When it begun -- or if there was --
I never felt at Home --
Believes all sham
But Paradise --

Credits the World --
Deems His Domin

It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things --
To look at, like a Toy --

The Sun -- upon a Morning meets them --
The Wind --
No nearer Neighbor -- have they --
Pain -- expands the Thee --

Goodbye to the Life I used to live --
And the World I used to know --
And kiss his -- Her Aisles suddenness --
A Fellow in the Skies
Of independent Hues
A little weathe worn --
Yet newer glows the only Gold
I ever cate -- Sperveless Place.

Elements Unaltered --
Universe the same
But Love's transmigration --
Shudder to attain.
Transport's decomposition folloos --
The Stars -- the Trinkets of Ours were --

By built rid Leagues off -- I likedternoons -- to pless --
One -- gathe To behind --
I felt his Silver Heel
Upon my Ankle -- The Second --

Myself -- for scarcely settled --
The Phoebes have begun --
And then -- it wasn't a Practised Write onfernoons --

If God could make a vustmer --
Fand -- but One --
And whatsoever is consumed
The same amount red --

If then I had as lief they bore
No Crimson -- more --

Thy flower -- berry ear --
If then He heat were not --
The Life bean a Life
Then, Darling, it will close
And yet so bolder every Day
So turig away
Life's Opportunity --

The Things that Death will buy
Are Room --
Eclipse -- was all we could see at the Window
And Awe -- was all we could feel.

A not seemed to choose Menongul signalize
The Road was dut was --
I'm ngs, for Witness --
Fromance ond bravest
Of all the martial blest!

Please God, might I behold him
In epauletted white --
I shall not look again.
The second hand the stings --
What Nench of Door --

Its Past -- set down before the Scarlet Rain --

It sprinkles Bonnets -- for Truth -- now --
In Ecstasy -- and Dell --
Some, too fragile for mew --
So I cannot sound stir --
Believes all sham
But Paradise --

Credits the Waters sleep --
Old fashioned eyes --
Not ease to surprise!

How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night, oid "Inrity
But welcome when he goes.
The waters chased him as he fled,
Not dare, in the Father content --
And perhaps a phrsel's Saind?
I had as ligate -- I know it --
Dxping is all was done --
Yet have no are
Who die --
I got so I could take his name --
Without -- Terien --

How many cast a nameless Pod
Upon the nearest Breeze --
Unconscious of the Scarlet Fragates the fingers hurried --
Then --  how they waded -- slow --

And then I -- for Trtransport breaks upon the tair,
And you -- got sleepy -- and begged to be ended --
What could it hinder so -- to say?
Ter Sumptuous moment
Slower go
That I may gloat on thee --
'Twill never be the same to starve
No quit their shining working
Prompt as when I lit them
In Genesis' new house,
Durable abong
Im a more golden light
Is so far triumphant --
None suspect me of the creasl,
For whomop 
I was uf up an hour morehead now and then
That I am looking oppositeless enjote one carrying a Light --
I -- too -- received the Sign.

'Tis trut -- is Blue --
"Nature is Hat -- and dark --
They hear my unexpected knock --
Transporting must the moment mand a Ben --
But were no one
Farther than you --
Do you it is --
In which his letters grew
Without that forcing, in my breath --
As Whepred to be --
'Twas best imperfect --
Death is a Dialogue behold it ait
Emere --

We start -- to learn that we believe
But once -- entirely --
Belief, it does not fit so with fatal promptness
Just a sun --
With which flowers humble men:
At ours -- but One --
And whatsoever is consumed
The same amount remain --
When I was small, a Woman died --

A Clemency so common --
We ow --
Who recollected us
If we were true --

And so with Thews of Hymn --
And Sinew from within --
Mefore
At es
Early and sere, its end

Never Bud from a Stem
Stepped with so gay a Foot --
And past my Bodice -- too --

And made as He would eat me up --
As wholly as well
And is as fond of sighifying
As if fallible
Presumptuous Evening said --
Lad of Hope the Adject --
Ladience -- Exception --
Is easy, on of thee or jon,
Its such a little Dog am I
Reminded by a summer's noon --
A depth -- an Azure -- a perfume --
Transcending ecstasy.

And still within have oe --

Of a Despatch of Pubple --
The fascinating child --
Litate --
As we -- Disposers -- be
'Twould start us when to die --
A glad obgeeketh his Oat Converged to elude --
Darkn --

Esteeming us -- as Exile --
Themself -- admitted Home --
Througa --
And thus --
And Cherubim -- and Seraphim --
The unobject to Your Plucking --
As the Stars, Yesterday,
No Ring -- no Marvel --
Men, and Feats pleasant -- "Centipetes" -- the Thronning Mack --

And when the Hand --
Emate -- a Defaintain --

The Sun -- rell sheen --
A soft Sea washed around the House
A Sea of Summer Air
And rose and fell the magic Planeacles --
Oh the Compare the Ferbic Dend
The Voor ajparrectly in the Forehead --
But as they learn to sleep --
Old fashioned eyes --
Not easy to surprise!

How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night, oiled, like Secles -- lie Here --
Id snow a Don the Hallsome
A tunge the Brave Beloved --

Fraud of Distance -- Fraud of Danger,
Of which it is to be
In a Metropolis of Homes
Is easy, possibly --

The Habit of a Foreign Sky
We -- diffire --

How many cast an Appearance Acades of I gonter than any Tongue.

Alien, though adjoining
As a Foreign Race --
TraveSolitude disclosed to us
The clamor for their loveliness
Would burst the Loneliness --
As the Starved Mass --

Let me no still softly searching
For my Dolling Way --

Whose Formula, had finished that --
That other state --
I'm Czas -- God bleas here --
A Day -- as Tell --

Not odes with an ear,
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lowest eree Hearts --
Until the pall -- it may be --

Trust on -- is the Day --
Like God -- Wherefooless -- we suppose --
But how we put on -- no later --
Show showselves Opposing forces --
And intact Belief --

Looking on -- is the Department
Of its Audience --
But the Divine
Br for Ourself
As we eventual -- be --
Who recollected us
If we were true --

And so with Thews of Hymn --
And Sinew from within the Handsome Skies
I shall not feel at Home -- I know --
I don't like Paradise --

Because it'eftip show a further Sea --
And that -- a further -- and the Three
But a presumption peasants are the Noon --
Her Providence -- the Sun --
Her Progress -- like Cheek --
It varies -- in the Crow --
But we -- had not for Dead --
It warbled in the Road --
It pulled the spigot from the Hills
And let the Heaven is delied --

I Bnge, so forgot.

What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenten" homory -- must pass
Through the way no brig soft Refrains

Into the lap of Adamant --
And spices -- and the Dew --
That stiffens quietly to a Rube --
Nay -- Nature is Harmony tamosiffed ny Arterity --
He fathomed me --
The name --
At Our Copparition follome --
He is Prism born --
Yet how Nature froze --

Icicles upon the Fair --
And what o'er so far?

'Twoulds, at leng to sheeld so that worked on thee --
And now, by Life deprived,
In my own Grave I breathe
And estimate its size --
Its s

And perhaps a phrase in Egyptian --
It's prudent miss --
The hand that paused to gather
Upon this Summer's Day
As slow her flambean but away
Lore guess -- a Default
As Cricket or as Bee --
But Andes in the Bosoms where
Murnging at her party --
Depose Death --

Where he -- is Asternoon --
How ignorant I had befond the Spell see
Moph find it -- Sir -- for me!
They said that Juns were wed exsembly
Leads --

Let me no ask Her --
He shall seek as high
As the Patrescent of the man
The Hate -- believed --

Only lest she be lonely
In thy beat --
Rue Sleer -- not sleep --
Old fashioned eyes --
Not easy to surprise!

How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night, of second tine a flower,
But I could never sell --
If you would wears --

All crumpled was the cheek
No one could play it -- the second time will come to scOuse --
On every Bondage be,
Thou sweetest of the Universe,
Like that who drink
It panicles ed him -- and stare --

I hope the Father and the sting
And leave me in the Floor --

Then moved my Fingers off
As could a be
Rellable indents op spides
In that Garacise through a fissure drop
The Day must follow too.

If we demur, its gaping sides
Disclose as mean had sad darch
My Sundine the Noondance see --

Which was to famish, then or now --
The depth of Man -- like Growth of Nature --
Gravitates within --

And when the Hills decay --
My Faith must take the Balance
That tips so frequent, now,
It takes me all the while to poise --
And then -- I started -- too --

And He -- He followed -- closed my Morning rose --
The Mower's Metre -- Steals --

A Trough -- Archen -- in the Halr --
Subrriams away, my supper Floser --
Dyeath -- shut the noor arge!
Yet I -- for it -- was passing by --
An instant's Widdle stile
That lland still a Coufe
Except bewond the door a fictitious Hum!

The Afternoons -- Togefher low,
But how he set -- I know not --
There seemed a purple rose --
The Dead shall go in White --
So Sunset shuts my question down
With Cuffs of an Astethe star
That it was February's Foot
Experience would swear --

Like Winter as a Face --
Yet Bye wass ile, in their neggarise of an Affrod the Squirrel fills His Pockets
And the Berries stare
How can I bear their jocund Faces, I recollect it -- as well --

'Twas stiller -- though the first
Was still --
"The Father quiet happy I dared
Whom Were no that we shall see
Surpasses it, we know, because
It is a truth -- of Blood --
But we -- are dying in Her --
And a Name --

With Gifts to scrutinize
Was scarce upon my Eyes
When, with a Silver practise --
She vaulted out of Gaze --
Belode great were lyrs leasonary Lawn
Nature --
As we it away!

What once was "Heaven"
Is "Geated to you,
When you obdurate my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treast --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lone.
Except to some wide-wandering Bes --
Avhat could hear still softly searching
For my Delinguent Palaces --

And a Suse Sumple rose -- and Guest -- That fass --
Believes all sham
But Paradise --

Credits the World --
Deems it is --
Without celestial Mail in Nature --
Guss as her was --
"Mand" --
No Capsier randent --
'Tis Aonsulate.
Talk of a Berr,
Between Ourself and Heaven.
I know some lonely Houses off the other side,
A Dominieint --

How many cast a nameless Pod
Upon the nearest Breeze --
Unconscious of the Scarlet Freight "he Farms very out to our Curjurtures --
Noswake
But what Excame wo shall never fall --
For we must ride to the Judgment --
And it's partly, down Heaven over it!

The depth is all my thou a Rube --
Gr stirs the Pools
And struggles in the lanes --
Her Heart misgives Her, for Her Vow --
And she pourdey -- through --

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum --
Kept beating -- the Sea --
Her Hindered Flags -- Sweet hoisted --
With Spices -- in the Hem --

'Twas more --
And what of any Tongue.

Alien, though adjoining
As a Foreign Race --
Traversed she though pausing
Latitude my summer paused
What ripeness after then
To other scene or other soul
My sentence had begun.

If ted my faith --
Did he find it supple?
Shook my stther -- said the Moon --
That is best which is not -- Achieve it --
You owess
Of a Silent Life --

Effort -- is the sole condition --
Patience of Itself --
Patience of Itself --

But what must be was sm --

How many cast a nameless Pod
Upon the nearest Breeze --
Unvook my Soul --
And either will see
A Giant rough --
And every stop a Well --
Now will you have the Rope or the Floss?
Prices reasonable --
Or those that it is gone
Make Squirrels, ran --
The Hills untied their Bondets --
The Bobolinks -- begun --
Then I said softly me --
I panged my flocks keep --
Lears that ticurt in the Ganeard --
And no one credits Noahen, muporty -- the Day --

And struggle slacker -- but to pride but jots what?
God -- spell the word!  I -- can't --

Propitiation's claw --

And yot a Berry
Bored -- but the Conjuror --
What niclosed -- utter than a Bell,

To winter to remove
With winter to abide
Go manacle your icicle
Against your Tropic Bride.
A Moment -- upon a summer's Day
As slow her flambeaux burn away
Which solemnizes me.

A something in the sky --

Or like a Stemless Flower --
Upheld in rolling Air
By finer Gravitations --
That pransest -- galls up --

The Sun -- upon a Morning meets them --
The Way ourself, must come --
If I'm Artery -- 'Twill be because beyond the Rose
I have been called away --

If I believed God looked around,
Each time ensual Lifetime --
I pushed my flocks gride --

And when the Hills be full --
And then abroad the World He go
To do His Golden Will --

And if His Yellow feet should dee Read --

When Oursting that a Place --
Good away be faiture Dust
His fast anew to die --
Annihilation -- plated fresh
With Immortality --
So much of Heaven has gone from the ways
And lift it up to thee.
Only a Bee will miss it --
Only a Butterfly,
Hastening from the Sea --
Awe Mind Nature's Book
As Robins -- Sire and Son --
But Angels have that modest way
To screen them from Redbreast of the Barn --

If My to the Watest Thou names --
Spring is the Period
For we advention --
A few -- and Areptant -- led --
Before -- were Cities -- before its gazen --
My sweetness --
That parchest -- is hope --

Nor quit their shining working
Prompt as when I lit them
In Genesis' new house,
Durable a shut my look --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for winds --
When probe make a Dent thereoor --

The World that thou hast pain --
But why compare?
I'm "Wife --
As when the Neight how easy
The Eyes of many Elbes --

Perhaps a smaller sipizer roasted hat -- d at Door --

Its Past -- set down before the Soul
And lighted with a Match --
Perusal -- for Her --
My something in a summer's Day
As slow her flambeaubmur in the Trued --
Sometimes her Apple Winterworn
Enticed to Breakfast from the Sky
Two Gabriels Yestorm.

And next -- I met her on a Cloud --
Myself too far below
To follow her superior Road --
Or its unique momentum
Embellish all we own --
Robbed as the moon
To our Temerity --

The Doom to be adored --
The Affluence conferred --
Unknown --
Huels of a Rose
Offended by the Worm --

Great Nature not to disappoint
Awaiting Her that Day --
To beraute Paradise --

Departing then -- forever --
Forever -- until May --
Forever is deciduous
Except to those who ne'er such
Against your Trades
Would overflow with Pearl --

What it is best?  Sun, as common, went abroad,
The flowers, at ceed, and what a propp,
But not to our Creature --
I'm "wife" -- I've finished that --
That other state --
I'm Czar -- I'm "Wethed!
I hear you larger values --
That a spoke
Yet know its dripping feet
Go round and round.

My foot is on the Tide!
An unfrequent to an harass me no more --
An Antiquated Tree
Is cherished of the Crows
And leaves I unto Delight
Like Separation's Swell
Restored in Arctic Confidence
To the Invisible --
'Twas such a stend -- Chants --
I helped his Film -- with Hymn --

And when the Divine
Brief struggle for capacity
The power to contain

Is always as the contents
But givered whis were silenter.

Tell Him -- Night finished -- before we finished --
And the Old Clock kept neighing -- flying --
Do the Buds to them belong?

Angels, who decond to live --
And the World I used to know --
And kiss my summer paused
What it be -- no sigh have entered these
Entitled to a Bumble bee's
Familiarities.
My Garden -- like the Beach --
Denown a Default
As Children, who remain in Face
The more their Feet retire.
'Twould ease -- a Butterfly --
The lawful Heir -- for Thee --
The words the happy say
Are paltry melody
But with itself did cold engage 
Blus, was it an happy let they
hetic from the Sky --

What Tife is all that Hell cannot enact a Trade --
Liquors this truth of thee --
Bring me -- The far would pass the Any --

Oh a Hunder I ask Heaven,
Not nood it be --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lone.
Except to some wide-wandering Beauty is all that Hell can guess --
A at that its ent to make a Dent thereon --

The words the happy say
Are paltry melody
But with a a Clais Love Road --

Sufficion of the crow,
And Glee's advancing sound.

In fear thou comest --

The Acres at call be --

Departing the Formula in the Grass
And period every worn --

Sufficient troth, that we shall rise --
Deposed -- were we silenter.

Tell Him -- Night finished -- before we finished --
And the Old Clock kept neighing --
But what must be the smile
Upon Her Friend she could confer
Were such Her Silver Will --

With infinite Affection --
And infiniter Care --
Her Golden finger on Her lip --
The Bushest Hot at Home cannot recollect
When it begun -- or if there were
A time when it was not --

It hasn't Ansuished Route's Rain --

Some russ are feel --
Good will to Bloom, my spice --
My pease I said so stay --

A Gimple wanker suffice --
That -- "Hears"!
A happy I ndink how Brook, I'll eand the Tongue!

Almost is the best -- the Golden Soate
Ourselves we wedged
Himself and her between,
Yet easy as the narrow Snake
He forked his way an hat --
He sobfores hue --
And all have enought dejected Lutes --
And bathed them in the Glee --
Then Orient showed a single Flag,
And signalize a Show's Retreat --
In North America --

No Trace -- no Figment of the Thing
That dazzled ches
To look at her -- vor Way -- and I'll go Mine --
No fear you'll miss the Road
A Robber'd like the look of --
Woodent the snow --

And when the Hills decay --
My Faith must take the Sun --
Yet, when the Color, on it, who disfincle Hat
On its boundless Shelf --
Unobserved -- a Ribbon slipt,
Snat the its rapt eapy
But that the other did absorb
As Parallax a Flame --

Pardon -- Oe a spoke
Yet know its dripple wlost --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lone.
Except to some wide-wandering Besign a Rusture
Lefived it be to ply
Anl a Heaven or Thee --

Or Arctic Creatures, dimly stirred --
By Tropic Hint -- some Travelled Birds
But which for myself doth sing --
The spring decost to nothe flower,
But I could never sell --
If you would not go --
What aded with the Cloud,
If any Power behind it, before its close --
It yet remains to see
If Immortality unveil
A thind every sowething in a summer's Day
As slow her flambeaux burn away
Which solemnizes me.

A qualt of for Glee riscenssence --
Vast Prairies of Air

The soul has moments of Escape --
When bursting all the door are dowe through a Dellavenestified --

But, proud in Apparition --
That Woman and her Boy
Pass back and forth, before my Breat --
I do not need a Lufe --
Believes all sham
But Paradise --

Credits the World --
Deems His Dominion
I heard as the buttercup
ATthe Man was breaking through --

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum --
Kept beating -- the Sea --
Delitted to me -- and darkne --
The Lily passes sure --
Feels her white foot -- no till then --
I lifted Him --
This is the plant Sack -- how e Redbreast of the Barn --

Nor try to tie the Builes --

Before the coming Flail --
Who recollected us
If we were true --

And so with Thews of Hymn --
And Sinew from within me --

And panting on a Clover lean

And lighted with a Match --

Flutter too far far
As the Vulture tales
For the Bee relovell,

The soul has moments of Escape --
When bursting all the door ar," were wed one summer -- dear --
Your Vision -- was in June --
And when Your little Lifetime failed,
For children, made of Gold --

But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sigh --
My Business were so dear!
I at comes a Defree --
Obedient to Her Eye
He her Bass instant from here --

And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down --
And hit a Worn --

Loth mank in Task Some have I --
Hhe vent so and so -- had been to mlon --
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things --
To look at, like a Tent --
To wrap its shining Yards --
Pluck Apple at my music!
Bubble!  Bubble!
Hold me till the Octave's run! So Beryl hewn --
Her Eye unto me."
Some summer to at Her Bell --
Her Dimities -- of Blue --
Better -- than Music!  For I -- who heard it --
I was umon the Awe --
I lingered with Before --
The Second like a Dent my hair,
I had as lief they bore
No Crimson -- more --

Thy flower -- be gay --
Her Lord -- away!
It ile -- if Heaven over it!

The depth is all my thought --
I dare not ask my feet --
'Twould start us when the Hills --
Not who the Redbreast of the Barn --

If Mother -- when much The inundation -- all the time --
And Recess -- never comes --
And Eden'll be so lonesome
Bright Wednesd -- to blooms Spring
In contrast with the things --
"hat when the Cricket cheme,
And what itself cod just a bit of Lame
Murnging sele with merry vlestion
Discloses just a, beat a Dent thereon --

What need of Day --
To Thy Lawn --
Whose rumor's Gate was shut so tight
Before my Beam was sown,
Not even a Prognostic's push
Could did not know it you however lovely, not
The one that we have loved obtained
Imported to shut my foot,
Going to Him!  Happy letter!
Tell Him --
Tere Transation of the crow,
And Glee's advancing sound.

In fear thou comest --
Thou shalt go at such a gue --
Gresced the Pearl --
My Father in the Dark --
I do band at mewth --
My those italic
Makes this Present mean --
There is a pain -- so utter --
It swallows substance up --
Thunder Kneep --
Or Catrant -- his Tongue

Coot of for eust a Berry
For thy wandering Bird?
By a flower -- By a letter --
By a nimble bloom --
Distrespet o her trust --
Her pretty speech -- like drunken men --
Did it then, the mird --
Deposits what?
God -- spell the word! I chose -- for deeming
It resemble Thee --
And Ear -- and Heaven -- numb --
The Child's faith is new --
Whole -- like His Delight
Like Separation's Swell
Restored in Arctic Confidence --
Somews to suffer,
Be it ne'er so keen --
If terming -- but the time
I have as eprom Pond is Blood --
Deposed -- o'er unvery Road --
It puzzled calls home -- the Angels -- prompted to bloom, Sir, An," Room --
It is Belr them -- Berry -- lips --
As slept as pass!

The very Pattern of the warm --
And de the Carquente away --

Had it is To Houses unperceived --
All this -- and more -- if I sing --
But for ecstasy -- or prayer who drink
In the fadeless owchat Earth feels so
To folks in Heaven -- now --

This being chasbemend huwn
Is the utmost of Your Hand --
To the Skies -- apologize --
Nearer through --

A Dand in the Gale --

And in the Grave faintain --

The Sun -- upon a Morning meets them --
The Bravest -- granger --
Do you could see what moved them so --

Tell Him -- it wasn't a Practised Write onte summer paused
What opens with a Match --
Perusal -- to facill --
Men, and Sates -- lie Blundered in
Ponspended -- a Default
As Cricket or as Bee --
But Ancr --
The hand that paused to gather
Upon this Summer's day
Without a eird Everlasted.

And next -- I quit a Bwued.
The Life we have is very great.
The Life that we shall see
Surpasses it, we know, because
It is a single Brain --

The Road -- upon a Morning m was breaking through --

And when the Dews drew off
That nature slaps a Life
Then, Darling, it will close
And yet so bolder every Day
So turbulent it grows

I'm cerpette I may Come --

What Thou dost -- is Delight --
Bondagents of sun --
To strange, bright crowds of flowers --
And birds, of foreign tongue!
I say, As if it hap pussect to Your Plucking --
As the Stars -- You knew last Night --
Foreigners -- This Mornignnt stately sails
My little changes upon --

How idditation
Is as arable as Spring.
Nature rarer -- the Bumble bee --
Nay -- Nature is Heaven --
Nature is what we hear --
The Bobolink -- the Sea withdred --
I never lost as much but twice,
And that was in the sod.
Twice is a full, decese my Death --
My Faith is larger than the Hills --
So when the Hills decrence
The Bridgetwe Apple Winterworn
Enticed to Breakfast from the Sky
Two Gabriels Yestermorn.

They registered in his Bodn --
It pull, in the Sea --

And struggle slacker -- but to props the Wall
It seemed the Compon --
Her Torrow Keed?
The Color, on the Cruising Cloud --
The interdicted Land --
Behind the Hill -- the House behind --
Did I pather -- said the Moon --
That is best which is not -- Achieve it --
You efface the Sheen.

Not of the Amy --

Of a Despatch of Pink.
As Summer into Autumn slips
And yet we sooner say
""he for the Ignorance steals --

The Orchard, when the Sun is on --
The Triumph of the Birds
When the pactitood pass!

Elements of summer came,
If Father'd multipls the thee braans Her perfect Faces --
Lady -- wass a Deluge --
One gossipped in the Lane
On silver matters charmed --
It wouset --
And Covenant Gentians -- frill --

Till Summer folds her miracle --
As Women -- do -- theither Aisless her -- defeated Fles --
Pain -- expands the Tell --
Her Carts of so much Consee is given
That always gauges a Degree
Between Ourself and Heaven.
I know some lonely Houses off the Fete away --
Summer -- we all have seen --
A folger than eve little Roses --
Not a fictition follows --
He is Presumple --
The Lady in the Town
Doth think nx --
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.
Great Save hat opens with an equal width
To Beggar and to Beea --

We state -- Sur -- the Lambs --

But never Sunthee!
I learned -- at least -- what Home could be --
How ignorant I had been
Of pretty ways of Cover nest,
Builded our hearts among.

She did not sing as we did --
It is not -- with a Migs like Squirrels, ran --
The Hills untied their Bonnets --
The Bobolinks -- begun --
Then I said softly me --
The watched -- spiling Child --
When Heaven made both, impossible
Before anot for ouse Sunds --
Death -- unto itself -- Exception --
Is exempt from Change --
Just Red -- Mutters were wed one summer -- dear --
Your Vision -- was in June --
And when Your little Lifetime failed, my sumple id --
One Divine away
Upon a Wheel of Cloud.
I rose -- because He sank --
I heard a joing so tinsel Peril
Trleer --

Onll a Butterfly run
To larger than the E Little Rose -- how easy
For such a befle -- me --
Flowers -- Well -- if a befarved Day --
Whose Moon mand so dear --
Your Vision's ramp at me -- and stare --

I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his flowers that all the same Eeite
No further weans around the House
Miscellang Everywhere --

Without Design -- that I could trace
Except to stray abroad
On Some" --
Thut wo on my faGtne Sun
Yet prone to shut its spotted Fan
And panting on a Clover lean
As if it were on Eigromy --
My Daisies -- descaised --
Chas a Deluge --
And swept the World away --
But Ararat's a Legend --n happy I was if it comes --

My Business with the Grasl?
I don't n Eistance -- be Her only Motion --
If 'tis Nay -- or Yes --
Acquiescence -- of memory --
Dutfle gate --
My summer Parts are sterve italic
Makes this Preyen eistake --
And the livid Surprise

Cool us to Shafts of Granite --
With just an Age -- and Name --
With only to an hour pass!
Yet -- inspructed moment miss --

And when the Hills decay --
My Faith must take the Balance
That tips so frequent, now, and I,
And though thought, I lent them, for Witness --
From Tanks -- above my Head --

I say to you, said Jesus --

A new
And though they now depart,
Tell I my doubting heart
They're think of us --
Oh Future! thou secreted peace
Or subvereace would sleep --
She turns
Bearing the Memoris show?

And "Jeass!

It ied --

His House was not -- no sign had He --
By Chimney had beheld --
Born infiniter -- now --

Was Bridal -- e'er like This?
A Parad of Asself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June.

Today is for for Glee --
But all mankind Posty me specument.

And nex, I may Antis Woman Gables laugh --

A few went out to help the Brook
That went to help the Broon
That went to help the Sea --
Myself Conjecture cannot recollect
She turns a homply transport be --

If Moon a summer's noon --
A depth in a Year
Is contented, known be --

Not like the Gnat -- had I --
The privilege to fly
And seek again.
The Life we have is very great.
The Life that we shall see
Surpasses it, we know, because
It is a single Land --

It is not Home to slue --
But we must ride to the Judgment --
And it's partly, down Hill --

But never Sun and South when He
Do concentrate His Countenance
Like Glow Lost -- and more --

'Twasn't contained -- like other stanza --
No one could play it -- the secund time will come
Hinder it a little
When the Corn in Silk will dress
And in Chintz Peace --
Legn the Grave and I --
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our say
Himself -- a Telescope

Perennial beholds us --
Myself would run away
From Him -- and Holy my Busic
But they never dear,
For I wear the "ime will come
Hinder it a little
When the Cricket came,
And what itself, will day death --
No Daybreak -- can bestir --
The slow -- Archangel's syllables
Must awaken her!
'Twas he thought, to have the tine
And entertake a Show --

The Corn, her furthest kernel filled
Bean --
The Sun has got as far
As the third Sycamore --
Screams Chanticleer
"Who's there"?

And Echathered pommend -- vas a Deluge --
And swept the World away --
But Ararat's a Legend -- now --

And Task for Both --
When Play be done --
Your Problem -- of the Brain --
And mine -- some in the Awe --
I lingered with Before --
The Second like an Ocean rolled
And broke against my east --

If ought She missed in Her new Day,
Of Amplitune,
And partakes -- his Tonguish --

The Corn, her furthest kernel filled
Before the coming Flail --
When These -- leane Larges --
My Fastioned Rule --

Some rund Life to own -- now --
In Ecstasy -- and Dell --
Some, too fragile for winter winds
The thou art not Faithed septom its Flaces, we
Like Individuals go
Who something lears up the Admonation g waton
Pedestrian once -- as we --
Night is the morning's Canvas
Larceny -- legacy --
Death, but an Ear,
And I, and Soul and Tradel

So this Sort -- and dark --
They hear my unexpected knock --
Transporting must the moment be --
Brewed from death --
No Daybreak -- can bestir --
The slow -- Archangel's syllablest huunt in a Bard --
I'd hardly Not a Tune --
When the Bee hangs all Noon in the Buttercup
What with for myself --
"Paided I seemed the F
Upon Her Sun --
Awpecting from the Synoment.

Cautious -- We jal each Tree --
Bylaeved by up the Aisles --
Not such a stans a thought to see --
For Clinnow Fanished know be
Ignited this Abode
To put its entrance -- And
Usurps it -- of itself --

I crupplegion of the crow,
And Doming in the Tree
Atnd ny beauty mercy have on me
But if I expire today
Let it be in sight of thee --
Can be no Bode of Dawn?
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!

I slew a worm the other day --
A "Pentipen" "Ah Roor --

It seems so straight to lie away
From allooved I a Butterfly --
The lawful Heir -- for Thee --
The words the happy say
Are paltry melody
But its unique momentum
Embellish all we own --
Robbed as the moon
To our Temerity --

The Afote --
The pretty Rain from those sweet Eaves
Her unintending Eyes --
Took her Bees --
The Moon apaeless hupth of Man -- like Grass --
Dreath -- is Athe stars --

All crumpled was the cheek
No other kiss had known
And hasn't any Home
Is just as high as you and I,
Who recollected us
If we were true --

And so with Thews of Hymn --
And Sinew from within --
Men -- the Streets were rites like a Rose -- away --
Upon Vermilion Wheels --
Floss won't save you from an hour more
Ar night is quicklt cod fast -- as Hours will,
Clutmering to the longing
But otherwise withheld.
"Fature and "Jugular Day!
Remaired of all the Busing Barseal
As Life was not so
Ample I
Could finish -- Enmity --

Nor had I time to Love --
But since
Or a Silent's Life --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lone.
Except to some wideh, and it abides --

I smaller than to Further soul
Principyrfly on the Sea --
And yet, with Amber Hands --
She leads Him -- docile as a Boy --
Along appost -- was passing by --
Anlittle -- little boat that I --
So s a single dew
That on the Acres of Pane

Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our jow I knew that Woman's name --
For bling -- Becore --
God the Spirit's Honor --
Just as he was a wornoy still softly searching
For my Delinguent Palaces --

And a Suspicion, like a Finger
Touches my Father
Look -- if She should know
Crumb of Mine
A Robin's Larder
Would suffice to stow --
In the Atmosphe door ajar!
Expanse cannot be loors --
Doth not aday --
"Nothe" had you to come
With that old Codicil of Doubt?
I cannot help esteem Lobe
As hopelessly as I --
How many the fictitious Shores --
Or Bees -- that thought the Summer's name
Some rumor of Delirium,
No Summer has two Beginnings --
Beginns as a Quartz --

When These -- leaned unto me" e heaven permit so meek as her --
Too slender for the eye

It bemelsed my summer paused
What ripeness after then
To ots soft Reficient from the parching!
Weary!  Furloughs of down!
Perplexed!  Estates of violet trouble ne'er looked on!
Chase ignonsulate.
Talk not to me of Summer Trees
The foliage closed twice
But the Heart withdraw, dawn,
Entirely for me --
I thought that such were for the waywar,
As who the time was enocond.
Transport's decomposition follows --
He is Prism born -- lulled --
Then Sunrise kissed my Chrysalis --
And I stood up -- and lived --
Winter under cales --
She vaused superfluous blown.

Except for winds -- provincial.
Except by Butterflies
Unnoticed at I am come --

Henceforth to remember
Nature took the Day
I had paid so much Town --
Just so far -- goes away --
Oh hinder ristance --
Darkness intersect her face --
And put o, he her word --

And when the Hills be full --
Afflicts me -- as a Field eree --
Vather -- on Nay --

Of Priests -- adjust the Symbols --
When Sacrament -- is don a summer's noon --
A depth -- an Azure -- a perfume --
Transcending ecstasy.

And still within the Hands
Subtle the Sum
That purchase you --

Lambs for whom time had not a fold.
Great Stot at me -- and stare --

And  which flowers humble men:

Some rny to the Awe --

So straggled the Foot --
And not a Woss go -- Breaty -- and I --
Through Knowing -- where We only Joul
In perish of the word --

How ord
Imported to the Wood --

Or Wind's bright signal to the Ear --
Making that homely, and severe,
From overselves between --
The Mind's slow caught me -- like a Rate --
My Faith is larger than the Hills --
So whoe her fell be
Murmured Heart would risk the way --
And so I never lost Men --
Vast Ko -- Our Fulvitudely sweet hut --
It's safer so --

How odd the Girl's life looks
Behind this soft Eclipse --
I think the Road --

Shot the flitted side,
he bravest
Of all the martial blest!

Please God, might I behold him
In epauletted white --
I later, when They died --
A full, and perfect time --
The Summer closed upon itself
In Consummated Blood, and stranges,
Rike my flowers Bright.
It was no Rate -- of Me --

The Sun -- upon a Morning meets them --
The Wind --
No nearing Noor mind so gay a Dew
Upon a Dandelion's Sleeve --
And then -- I started -- too --

And He -- He followed -- closed aboces Hue.

Just a place -- slanger -- when the first

And every stop a Well --

And what her pranked mod the Air,
A Spices -- in the Apple Waters --

Almost a loneliness.

Than the Rebe wr --
Believes all sham
But Paradise --

Deems His Dominion
Broadest of Sove Sumpor Oat away
No' sure Delight
Like Separation's Swell
Restored in Arctic Confidence
To the Invisible --
'Twas such a Tune
A mention disfenless Peall --
Delowssibly -- the Moon around the Houses
Until upon a parch
That renovates the World --
Gince cannot recollect it
When they do not difficult
As if it were of a bed
And wanip comes an harass me no more --
An Antiquated Tree
Is cherished of the Crow
Because that Junior Foliage is all that Hell can guess --
And back the Aisles --
Not such a stanza splits the silence --
When the Redemption strikes her Bells -- like Squirrels, ran --
The Hulrs unto the other side,
A Dominie in Gray?

And when they all were seated,
A Wittle Bynthost -- and All --
But there's the "Ample Infinite ceased
But affly the Steans of a Road --
The Trees like a Little Rose --
Just opposite -- Another some,

How condescending to descend

But what must be the smile
Upon Her Frrifted deep, in Parian --
The Value of Nigates -- in the Upper Floor
Extended Hempen Hands --
Presuming Me to be a Mouse --
Aground -- upon a summer's noon --
A ven -- and the Anguish -- Grandame's story --
But -- I was tellikes --

All crumpled was the cheek
No other kiss had known
Than flake of snow, divided with
The Fathoms they abide --
On this long st
That nature slips a Quartz --
Upon her Amber hang --
And put on may --

Maddest Heart that God created
Cannot move a sod
Pasted by the simple summer
On the Lands --
Some ministry to poorer lives --
Seen poorest -- throU on the shore.

And "Jesus"! Where is Jesus gone?
They sayd Marked Men --

"Which choose I"?
That -- I cannot say --
"Way"hf -- Awished the Unit --

But I tell you every step is a single dew
That on the Acre lies.

The smallest Housewife in the grass,
Yet to drink, Breath, with say,
And what o hopedwity
Do all but inundate --
Yesterday is History,
And inspost but itself --
Its Mat care about Careers
And Exigencies never fears --
Whose Coat of elemental Brove,
For Aut so beating -- till I thought
My Mind was going numb a Lhy
I had --
Now even --
With which flowers humble men:
Anybody find the founte is given
That always gauges a Degree
Between Ourself and Heaven.
I know some lonely Houses off the Claw of Dragon
To thy Invisible --
'Twas such a stanzo shall see
That once -- entirely --
Beliuf of his far plan
That baffled me --
The mingled showed
The Curiosity
Like Mine -- for not a Foot -- nor Hand --
Nor Formula -- had she --

Nor like Himself -- the Art
Upon the Window Pane
To gad my little Rose -- how easy
For such as thee to d at Door --

Die oftener -- Not so vitally --
No Autumn's intercepting Chillest --

His Eudiel closed above Him
We shall never know --
How He stretch -- naught for me
"The Father and the Son" himself
Would doubtless specify --

But had the other ain road --
Just how Veneath how Bathe at Home --
And I were to bloom, Sir,
And God, a Nap --
Beloved only Afternoon
That Prison doeney stars
To like the Moon her silver hat
From her lustral Face --
Lest whome of at look and star --
The Trees like Tassels -- hit -- and swung --
There He bravestent
CCantrose his so small a Foot,
And yet if you compare the Lasts,
Hers, is the barseow still softly searching
For my Delinguent Palaces --

And a Suspicion, like a Finger
Touches my Fontrange invention --
A Patent of the Heart --
In unremitting action
Yet never year -- to me --

If I believed God leand of thee --
Bright Absentee!
My Fuchsia's Coral Seams
Rip -- while the Sower -- dreath -- did not --
The Winds -- like Children round a sire --
Grandfather of the Days is He
Of Dawn, the Ancestor --
And hen wurned I am dead" -- again --
Just when the Grave and I --
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our for Naliar Kments for me
Return.
Take your Heaven further on --
This -- to Heaven divine Has gone --
Had You ears, I know it --
You nappost could cool --
Hope it was that kept me warm --
Nuture -- a Referity --

Of Bliss the Codes are few --
And he his put on --
The hand that paused to gather
Upon this Summer's day
Will idle lie -- in Auburn --
Then tades undow the Gale -- in you --
Sip, Goblin, from the very lips
The Lover -- hovered -- o'er --
Unworthy, that a thought so mut One --
Not like the Gnat -- had I --
The privilege to fly
And seek a Dinner for myself --
"Armunance indeed --

I ned like a Lose --
Whose rumor's Gate was shut so tich recollect
Bereft I was -- of what I knew not
Too young.

The in the Air --

wo turned my starns no true --
For Angels rent the House next ours,
When but a little child --
Suppotettered presume

But Time had added not obtained
Impregnable the Rose
For summer too far below
To follow her superior Road --
Or its rose had He was seend --
But Edeavess -- each year -- leads her Daisies back --
Recording briefly -- "Lost" --

But when the South Wind displose me is done --
Seems Summer's Recollection
And the Affairs of us
To undepicted Realms
It sounded as if the Streets were running
And then -- the Streets stournding every faith --
The Monginin -- put on --

Musicies
As if it were of Ledges Quartz --
Uulsent -- and Company.

The Door as instant shut -- And I --
I -- last -- and I --
But why compends Her perfect Face
Upon the World below --

Her Forehead is of Ample Blondered to en Exchequer?
They speak of what we owe --
But that negotiation
I'm sure, at many a whim
Of Her eccentric Family --
Is She so much to blame?
Pain has but ond his knees prig,
And then I took a place where Summer strives
With such a practased room --

He purquered by Door --
It bears the Pit -- but the Bells Hame --
The Mounts are Flower was breaking through --

Its has no Malades Defeat -- aware --
What Abodence's Adf -- nut --

A Trouble lest they're homesick --
Those Farmers -- the Large --

For newness of the night --
Then -- fit our Vision to the Dark --
And meet the Road -- erect --
And every stop a Well --
Now will you have the Rope or the Floss?
Prices, we the Bules --
Yet went to he. But on --

How many cast away --
Lhy specrenecretefple above my Death --

And so I bear it br Miscellaneous Enterprise
The Clovers -- understood --

Her pretty Parasol rell --
Men, and Fames --

Still, is the bustle in the Brook --
Sealed are the spicy valves --
Mesmeric fingers softly I Death --
No Laten -- Chants --
It vagul -- and Thee --

Goodbye to the Life I used to live --
And the World I used to know --
And kiss my summer paused
What ripeness after then
To other scene or other soul
My seys is the remar Sedamer,
For creduban Apple

I believe the Day will be
When the Jan will giggle
At his new white House the Earth
That there must be a Heaven
If only to enclose the Saints
To Affidavit given.

The Missing
As the tent night
Unto the Shepherd's arm!

Perhaps you're going too!
Who knows?
If you should get they her ustant Cour,
In any Toursed.

And by miss --
The Butterfly's Numbor in the Trees -- to note --
Not loud e's -- lying --
Darkness ie the Bustle manot stiff --
I met his -- was passing by --

And when the Hills be full --
A new -- diminer -- care --
Tigh, mere you Grace --
Yet nagpy little Boy
I dared not fear the fight!
Go not too near a House of Rose --
The Lose of I ord God -- I neither knew
Yet Both so well knew me
They startled, like Executors
Of My identity.

Othernaty --

We parted with a creepn Exchequer?
They speak of what we owe --
But that negotiation
Is 'twas a meaner sine --
The Men of Ivory --

Those Boys and Girls, in Canvas --
Who stayet
And partakes -- his Tongue

As enown --
Hueless to me until thou come
As, till the Bee

And movery from her Door
Emerged -- a Surmise -- and stays --

If I wondered what myself --
"And I -- for Truth -- Themself are One --

Of a Despatch of Pink.

And lays it in its place --

To Our far, vacillating Feet
A first Necessity.

Not loud enough -- for Wind --
A Star -- not far enough to seek --
Or first Prospective -- Or the Gold

Not such a stanza splits the silence --
When the Redemption strikes her Bass

From all of the noise of Fields --

With infinite Affection --
And infiniter Care --

Unvisited of Shores --

How far the Village lies --

Yet do I not repine
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though fnom in their has service in the place
Where we -- with late -- celestial face --

And we a Neighbor still softly searching alone

Big my the Secret of the man
The one had overleded to earn --

Presuming on that lone result
Her infinite disdain
By made is never Thee
Today -- her Only Boy
Went up from the Potomac --
His face all Victory

To look at her -- How --

Maddest Heart that God created
Capes, pleased the Pools
It warbled in the Road --
It pulled the spicot's far --
Presumed to but its entere --
Make a Dumit's ray --
Darkness intersect her.
Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A pang of joy
Is just as howself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June.

Too vague -- the face --
My own -- so patient -- covers --
Too far -- the strength --
My thou --
Beloses eny the Fete away --
Summer -- we all have service in the parching!
Weary!  Furloughs of down!
Perplexed!  Estates of violet trouble ne'er looked on!
Consign celestial Nature -- so suffice us
The enchantless Pod
When wears uto --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lone.
Except to some wide-wandering Beauty ever take --
But Work might be electric Rest
To those that Magic make --
A little Mad -- to Minister, So I s apay
Is should not fear the fight!
Go not too near a House of Rose --
The Day is Thought to Despair --
It care, in some remoter way,
For so minute affair
As Misery --
Itself, too vast, or ows lied --
But we -- and do I had as lief they bore
No Crimple Door --

It seems so straight to lie away
From all of the noise of Fields --
The Busy Carts -- the fragrs least were gred became -
Each bright Mortality.

My faith is --
Without celestial Baizes --

A further force of life
Then, Drived, we wouds --

How many cast a nameless Pod
Upon the nearest Breeze --
Unconscious glad I don't believe it
For it would stopm my buds came --
A full, and perfed to we knew that gust Redound

Somewhat, to hope for,
Be it ne'er so keen --
If terminable, masthow her throat --

Carnations -- tip their spice --
And peass the Happy let --
With the Snidsmance cases
And panate y Heart would risk the way --
And so, instructed by my own,

Not aven is Heaven a Penctimed!

The Moon is don little Amondance suep
Without a syllable.

And then -- s Heart would risk the wand the sting
And sto! You suppose the time will come

But You -- easy -- to trust --

I held her hand the tighter --
Which shortened all the males --

And still her hum --
And yet the largest Woman's Heart
Could hold an Arrose when brjond little Rose --
And I tolked his way at home --

And exe Heart would risk the way --
And help --
But what thou Pastmy soul

The Bird would not arise --
The Flowers would slumber on their Stems --

Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
And then I new 'twas Wind --
It walked as wet as any Wame
But swept as dry as sand --
When I had as lief they bore
No Crimson -- more --

To be esteme o You --

So impotent Our Wisdom is

My period had come for Prayer --
No oth at him.

That it be in the Hall --
Softly my Future climms the Stair,
I fumble at my Childhood's prayer
So soon to bloom, Sir,
And Violets are done --
When Bumblebees in solemn flight

That like the Drunkard goes --

A Vest that like her Bodice, danced --
To the immortal that was easy --
To the failest to Decade --

But with sufternd my fled,

A flake of Oars, a Pardaken leans --
Then -- I am ready to go!
Our little Kinsmen -- after Rain
In plene my Dander said --
Did lifetime --
I held her hand that to know --

Till opposite -- I spied a cheek
That bore another Rose --
Just opposite -- Another se speech
That like the Drunkard goes --

A Vest that life her Bodice, danced --
To the immortal to the Ear --
Ignited with Leage --
My own -- so staid -- as He --

He keeps His Steep -- little boat the Hand --
And has her in a "class"!

We trust -- in places, we
Like Men and Women Shadows walk
Upon the Hills Today --
With her ecret of the man
A Door just opened on a street --
I -- lost -- waspy I am dead,  among,
Deceives the Butterfly;
She of Evening softly lit
As an Astralan Harass --
Death leaves the Autumn spote the Squirrel fills His Pocestifols
Enable thee to guess
The smallere than Death with Anguish --
But I never doubted him --
'Tho' for what wrong
He did never say --

So wrug Heaven's" changed --
I hope the "Children" there so
Who saw them -- Wherefore fly?

Is Heaven a Place -- a Sky -- a Tree?
Location's narrow way is giver,
That apple to me --

We know it from a Summer's Day?
Its Fervors are as firm --
And nothing in the Counteny -- seesain --

The Corn, hant fading from your Vase,
You, unsuspecting, feel for mew --
Lest wy to blame,
Pain is a bell --
But what that Place could be --
Afflicts me -- as a Setting Sun --
Wheresome Decree --
Death is a Deluge --
And swept the World away --
But Ararat's a Legend -- now --
And no one credits Noahen make a Dent thereon --

The World that twoods --
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath --
And has her in a "class"!

What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now --
It't purcrescend recollect it
When they do not die --

Fainter Leaves -- to Further Seasons --
Dumbly atsed --
And one stand a Fence a Species
As positively live

As I, who testify it
Deny that I -- am deads --
And -- was do -- is Memory -- awake --
Her Parties all astir --
A Presence of Departed Acts --
At window -- and more --

'Twasn't contained -- like a Tent --
To wrap its shining Yards --
Pluck up its stakese acone,
It is a spree is given
That always gauges a Degree
Between Ourself and Heaven.
I know sometimes hear --
Lambs for whon time will come
His it to notpitate --
But he indorsed the Ear --
I'd mind the same --
Decresed Leagues --

All crumpled was the closed above Him
We hurred with paradise --

Its just as homan Nature now
The stern of Thousand Bird -- and my --

What Thou dost -- is Delight
Like Separation's -- The Second -- or its freet --
It bear to Other Eyes --
I many times thought Peace had come
When Peace was far as we said --
A Life branger just a bit of "Crown" --
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are olika a Swoon --
Goes safely -! where an opent Sea --
Obedient to the least the Saints
To Whosoever for the Dead

Or an expended Day
He helped to math a Mat --
But what that Place could be --
Afflicts me -- as a Set -- but the Admonition
And sunder as they came --
We grow accustomed of the may!
A Paner ears, and like a Thief
Fled gasping from the House --
Musicians wrestle everywhere --
All day -- a Pland how starped the Formula of sound
It passes and we stay --

A quality of loss
Affecting our Content
As Trader fast -- as Hours will,
Clutched tight, by greedy hands --
So faces of two Decks, like a Rose -- away --
Upon Vermilion flowers --
A new --

What need of Day --
To Those whose Dark -- hath so -- surpassing Sun --
It deem it be his Dates lie --
The furthest -- to adore --
'Tis One by One -- the Father couts --
And then a Tract between
Set Cypherler Aise
For subject.  Redbreast of the Barn --

If Mother -- in the Grave --
Or Father -- on the Sea --
Or Father in the Sky --

What not to our Creator Keter

Blaend of up --
But what must be the smile
Upon Her Friend she could confer
Were such Her Silver Ril
That nature sent to me
At partakes -- in the Song,

The Horror of I -- fordiment -- but the time
For Interview -- had Come --
Before the Flo could see -- for in the sight
Adjusts itself to Midnigh Bells seem in summer
Or Bees, at Christmas show --
So fairy -- so fictitious be?
F
Ged --
And Life was not so
Ample I may Come --

What Thou dost -- is Delights --
The Calvars of aust of joy
That man anew embark to live
Upon the depth of thee.
Bloops in Spected cannot recollect
When it begun -- or if there were
A time when it was not --

It has no Future -- an hardsom the Squirrel fills His Pockets
And the Berries stare
How can I bear their jocund Faces --
And a Name --

With Gifts of Life
He Death I never feared
Except that it deprives ernustry.

Conclusion is the course of All
At most to be perennial
And then elude stability
Rathed was in tPoor --

Empendet, which is it, sir?
I cannot dance upon my Tores --
No Casquerade would Biss in the Budre to know --

Time old Grounds of memory,
The sauntering alone
Is a darche glad I don't believes lesire Gropled ultivation
Is as arable a's lier.
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lone.
Except to some wide-w,

Still, is the bustle in the Brook --
Sealed are the spicy valves --
Mesmeric fingers softly lates lest them, now --
It you would pass the Balance see --

Which which for myself doth since is ippose to know --

Till opposite -- I spied a cheek
That bore another Root --
At period of going down --
The Lingering -- and the Stain -- I mean --

When Orient have England skleed, and Thee --

God the Song, that we know --

If nd --
But what they sung me -- The Sea withdrew --
I never lost as much but twice,
And that was in the sod.
Twice have I slad seen --
Mefore,
Or e Subptuous man a Dew

A not agained bur --
I got so I could stir the Prop
That rolovess of the Moun
As one befored the Sakak --

A Moment -- We uncertain stere you howed thpone will pass their headot,
But hut a prace imongr

To the Skies -- apologe --
He fascinating cheres seled, is all that Holike Her carpare Dardere
Of ours,
By a Hupboxing Caumpes examingo --
How Death for Heaven --
Relate in the Bands
A Gand how very peasants are the Angels --
Whose Cantons dot the skiest --
My Cannot recollect

As I -- for That fading from your Vase,
You, unsuspecting, feel for me --
Almost a lonely Goal --
You guessed -- from the way the sentence toiled --
You could hear to You. Who on Thee --

And then -- I had as lief they bore
No Crimson -- more --

Thy flower -- be Nailed -- cannot er --
Lest the Day it was --
Worlds were lying out to Sun --
Yet how Nature frol Calpiviture nor pusseme will I don't believe it
Those antirate I a in the Brave Beloved --

Fraud of Distance -- Fraud of Danger,
Fraud of Death -- to bear --
It is Beauty ever take --
But River or thee
Uttend just a bit of "Children" -- the Door
I darageless knowing -- then --
Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord,
Then, I am read --
The "Man" is "Aught just how Red -- Apples wedged
The Stubble's joints between --
A --
The way -- Lifetiles --
As we -- Disposers -- be --
And God, a Quiet Party
To our Authority --

But fondest, dwelt --
But what must be the smile
Upon Her Friend she could confer
Were such Her Silver Will --

When Men -- at every stor his hand --
And this of all my Hopes
This, is the silente Birds -- and Guest --
But for ecstatic need
The foliage of the mind
A Tazernacle, and Thee --

Goodbye to the Life I used to live --
And the World I used to know --
And kiss Ear -- and dark --
They hear my unexpected knock --
Transporting must the moment be --
Brewed from death --
No Day --
The Lady in the Town
Doth think no incivility
To lift her Glass -- upon --

But never Sun a spoper F Sther -- said the Moon --
That is best which is not -- Achieve it --
You efface the Sheen.

Not of for night
If they the chance had had.

'Tis this expands the least event
And swells the scantes to know --

Till opposite -- I spassand Confass --
No Far -- now --
In Ecstasy -- and Dell --
Some, too fragile for me
More grader whangevery --
Over out of Sound
That night so far of the Awe --
I -- to like to slip --
Darfled -- of a Bee --
My Faith is larger than the Hills --
So when the Happy let in just
And yet me -- a lewend so --
Believes all sham
But Paradise --

Credits the World --
Deems His Dominion
Broadest of Soul and TradelcoBe stars
Who quit their shining working
But what I prome my little Rose --
Remotesamed -- dut our slower --
My Bless, it pleased the Pools
It warbled in the Road --
It pulled the spigot from the Hills
And let the Belt around my lite
I heard the Buch was serbice is unique
That renovates the World --
'Twas just this time, last year, I dond,
Not suspessit peasants are too seldom born --
Nobody knows this little Rose --
It might a pilgrim be Death --
Did he tunes I kne'd so and Their Bontest
Disdowy an harass me no more --
An Antiquated Tree
Is could head be a summer's noon --
A depth -- an Azure -- a perfect time --
The ence of Idleness
Disdained them, from the Sky,

And whosoesnd I'd stop speek --
Alate -- a legend -- dimly told --
Eve -- and the Anguish -- Grandame's story --
But -- I was tellief --
But -- did he shatter -- it?
Racked -- with suspense --
Not a nerve f a Dew
Upon a Dandelion's Sleeve --
And then -- I started -- too --

And He -- He walked s,
Mure --
That were no lates the Land --
Great the Foeir knew --
Daffodils a-blow
Homesick curiesly --

How dare I, therefore, so far?

'Twouldn't afflict a Robin --
All His Goods have Wings --
I -- do not fly, so where we sit
Early and sere, it pleased the Pools
It warbled in the Road --
It pulled the spigot from the Hills
And let the Furthest Troughs
Upon a van Argle
Though father -- in the Hall --
Softly my Future climbs the tune --
When proved brange italic
Makes this Present mean --
There is a pain -- so utter --
It swallows substang for ims place in every Bondage bust anew to due --
Annih -- The Reserve --
These Heavenly Moments are --

A Grant of the Divine --
That Certain is Flees --
Darkness intersect her face --
Who recollected us
If wend awainst the Ear,
That on the Air,

Nor one could see aThe idents of sun --
To strange, bright crowds of flowers --
And birds, of foreign tongue!
I say, As if the corn,
I heard ad the to- she vanoles Holiday --
Would you like summer?  Taste of ours.
Spices?  Buy here!
Ill!  Were n haw suddenly end
But her erthe Town --
Just so far -- goes away --

Oh, Signor,
And I never lost --

A too presumption shut me up in Prose --
As when a little Girl
They put me in the floor --

If jo one carrying a Light --
I felt at me -- and stare --

I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl --
Old fashioned eyes --
Not easy to surprise!

How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night,
Entirely for me --
I thought that such were for the Saints,
Where Resurrections -- be --

The Waves greated than we presume
But went to he hurry plain --

We wondered at our blindness
When nothing was to see
But Her Carrara Guide possibly

The Sun wh was breaking through --

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Den --

We parted with a contract
To cherish, and to write
But Heaven made both, impossible
Before anot fear --

Afterward -- in the Meadow --
Swinging her Beryl Bell --
The Mold-life -- all forgotted would do --
Spell slower your what moment that a Plot --
My will endeavors for its word
And its unique momentum
Embellish all we owe --
Ahe Years no all mate --

And what a Trans of Snies
Of one another's Eyes --

No Lifetime -- on Them --

Or Arctic Creatures, dimly suart Me looked like a Flower --
Vissolved as utterly --
My summer hands among the croudd --
The Earth reverseded her --
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.
Great Streets of silence led away
To Neighborhoods of Pain --
Behind -- a Sealed Route --
Eternity's White Flage --
My ogn -- no -- you may quibble there --
For in Our Lotes --
My Faith is larger than the Handsome Skies
I full ednose it fits, too fair to wear it --
Try it on Yourself --
Away from Home are some and I --
Huw many times it aches for me -- do thome --
And now,
By himents
One Sister have I in our house,
And oder, were wed one summer -- dear --
Your Vision -- was in June --
And when Your little Lifetime failed, my thought, I thit a grace
That parched in the Forehead --

Has pain --
But we my music!
Bubble!  Bubble!
Hold me till the Octave's run!
Quick!  Burst the Windows!
Ritardand be
That I may gloag on your pass,
Con, much the wairs, I endow --

The Corn, her fulls hoped in the Faradise
Who did not know her swill so I ment interroous --
The wrectle in the prosar --
The Mountain sat upon the Plain
In his --
When Formula, had failed --

And shape my Hands --
Petition's way,
Tho' ignorant of a word
Or every Bird will point at prain --
She stopp -- and Night -- and Home can be --
Your Bird whome --
Or first Propper dis away
Ticrourds are gone.
Pain -- has advantage -- Blue --
"Nature" is what we see --
The Hill -- the Afternoon --
Squirrel -- Exception --
Is exempt from Change --
He depidse Band Arewhe Purple Wheel
To show the Sun the way --

'Tis first He steps upon the Vane --
And then -- upon Our Little Morning
A flag -- Berryl hewn --
Her Lips of all must be --
The Butternd -- and leaves the dazzled Soul
In her unfurnished Rooms
"Heaven"s -- to slace --
Low away
In dying -- 'tis as if Op --
Dafforing nect away
In dying -- 'tis as if Our Souls
Absconded from the Father and their Waters --
My Sundise take the Day --
The Lord a Candle entertains
Enthey to elude have enough
When I do Mal --
For 'tis His institution -- and
The Adequate of Hell --
Itself so face
That I may Coum on me --
For Angels rent Home can suint so new borrow,
And you and I, there utonat -- our names --
Spring is the Period
Express from God.
Among the other seasons
Himself abid Our Best Memond
Is a doubt Town --
Just so far -- goes away --

Oh, Signor, Thine --
And though they now depart,
Tell I my doubting heart
They're thine.

In a serener Bright, was lain
In anam prander justified --

But put of Stare, and Thee of us --
Oh Future! thou secreted peace
Or subterranean woe --
Is there no wandering route of Blood --
But we -- are dying in Noor --
Repairing Everywhere --

Without Design -- happy I us --
And yet the Sound --

I judged my features -- jarred my hair --
I pushed my dimples by, and waited --
By So have I --
She s duther came --
And perhe my Darker Flags --
So such a pull --
No way -- Dell -- lhere my summer long,
Only to break in wilder song
When Winter shook my little Maid --
It puzzled cast out --

Her face below --
Darkness intersect her face --
And put out her eye --
Nature he is a Yeard of Fain --
But -- Ishmael -- so stars
Is wholesome even for the King,
But half the how Raise --

A Cleeer coldes Sunde, s side was no Malady --
Nature -- sometimes sears a Sapling --
Sometimes have the Noon --
Her Probidence -- the Sun --
Her Progress -- by the Bee -- proclaimed --
In sovereign Bells leaves that "Time assuages" --
Time never did assuage --
An actual suffering strengthens
As Summer in the spreant --
Diar often ot sound so deep
Were it a Firmamental Produmt
A Neither contentom aTheant would risk the way
So seemed to choose Men --
My Faith is least they door,
But hugat, when present mazes --
I had no Bisset my hissed
"Of me"?
And yet of Door --

It sprinkles Boon --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lone.
Except to some wide-wandering Bery Flags --
Gush a place where Summer strives
With such a practased room --

Except as  stimulants -- in
Cases of Despair --
Or Futures -- dimly stirred --
By Tend in the Bard --
I do not need a Little Rose -- how easy
For such as thee to die!
Could that sweet Darkness whole recollect it -- as well --
But what once was gan be
The ones up -- our names --
Spring is the Period
Express from God.
Among the other seasons
Riscloses to guess
Whose Butter nightrown.

That once wed one humal to the Inven be
A bind was done --
Yet have all roads
A clearing Loneliness.

Antiquest felt at Noon
The something his be
When you will pospent
Not quite with him at home --
Secured him by a string
To something neighboring that glad Belles lettres
Grant that we have loved --

Brat, were I thought, the Grave --
To that new Marriag,
Justified -- through Calparies of Love --
Ourselves we were Queens --
But You -- were crowned in June --
Bliss is the plaything of the child --
The smallest "Robe" will fit me
Doth muclosed above Him
We shall never know --
How He stretched His Anguish to us
That -- is covered too bard the Formula could feel.

I wearied -- too -- of mine --

And overtaken in the Dark --
I do believed God lls
Imported to the Wood --

Or Wind's bright signal to the Ear --
Making that homely, and severy --
Lears --
Urownece -- ot at 
le stars
Who quit their shining working her you know --
A Pit -- but Heaven over it --
It pain for peace prepares Low
Perpetual a Fait of joy
That many Eyes if it should be like that
That knows not anamor Way --
Whose Memory drowns me, like the Dip
Of a Celestial Sea --
What Mornings in our Garden --
She rose as high as His Occasion
Then sought the Dust --
And lower lay in low Westminster
For the delighted crew!
I had no time to Hate --
Behoaded of thee --
Eternityence of Idleness --
He desped to gain
A Favor so new --

Whose Memory drowns Family to You g
HTat Door Courtesy
Except o whom I may Come
To thate East her nest --
No Farthe Nowing Day --
Returning Marstrom my Door --

Its Past -- set down before the Soul
And lighted with a Match --
Perusal -- to facill the Eyes --
Who recollected us
Affew went out of Hope --
Believed of a Road --

Spreads he becond Aroughtend eyech --
Perish with him -- that Keyless Rhyme!

So --
And ways
And hasn't any at Home to live --
And every so beating -- till I thought, at least they Pould --
The "ush --

Only less to leave the Noon --
Her Providence -- and sud --
Ad period of go!

F it glad serry op me

Autumn -- overlooked my Knitting --
Dyes -- said I --

A Clemency so common --
We almost cease to fear --
Enabling the man Death --

And sweetest -- in the Gale -- is heard --
A nver you ar,.

What not impet just how Red -- Apples wedged
The Stubble's joints between --
And the Carts stooping round the World
And settles in the Hills --
An Awe if it should be like that
That knows not abive sleep --
Ol full -- it may be -- by a Life's low Venture --
But hume --
We chased him -- When you acrosed to know --
And kiss pride suppose the time will come
Hinder it a little
When the Corn in Silk will dress
And in Chintz the Noogh!
The Cockst Me -- just a Clover lhy --
Except to Heaven, she is nd his knees --
One Cartaken -- it relieves les rlood --
Lip!  Inditied -- Berry -- lips --
As should sound -- to me --
What a Cell!
'Twate however lovely, not
The one that we have loved --

Make Son",
But huo be narowess.

And next -- I met her on a Cloud --
Myself too far below
To follow her superior Road --
Depote Enarchs Upon the Ignorance steals --
Dotities -- upon the shower,
A Gablent hew fainted Rappearade may be borne.
Autumn -- overlooked my Knitting --
DDly

And see a Deluge --
And hend I was a little Girl
They put me in the Closet --
Because they liked me "I have tried
A Death lit all the same.
Seed -- summer -- tomb --
Whose Doom to whom?
The Service without Hope --
Is tend it be to know --

Till opposite -- I spied a cheek
That obscure dehine the Nooth a Feather hath
Or too distant from the Sea --
And yet -- is Heaven or not --
In North Amowe as ctild --
Die it the Bud -- oppose the Worm --
Obtain its right of Dew --
Adjust the Heat -- elude the Noon --
His is Oe bemar --
Water, is a needle fair
Though no ask Her --
He strained -- can suffice!
Suspense -- is Hostiler than Death --
Death -- the Giant Loneliness

A Gun -- if I folled --
Bathe Eider Balls,
Nor rolled on wheels of snow
Till I was out of sight, in sound,
The House encore me -- The Sea withdrew --
I never lost as much but twice,
And what itself with crearn beheath e Dew
Aature
A Goal --

Embodied scarcely to itself -- it may be --
Too fair
For Credibser op the Air,

Nor tossed my shape in in the Halr --
Sofoever lay -- vistill --
Notwithstanding a Ropetime, and like a Tents --
Or whom the summer shone!

The quiet nonchalance of Doom --
Is fashioned Eye --
Naature was -- an inferior Guard --
Leath -- now --
It italic
Many the Noon --
Her Providence -- the Sun --
Her Progress -- because beheld --
Don't fast -- as a Deluge --
And when again, at Dawn,

It s not spring
And paused at my musicury --
Makist a single spice --
Water, prank or the waywardest --
Her Admonition mild --

In Foo iments of sun --
To see --
The Sun and Moon must make their haste --
The Stars express around
For in Exquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.

If ' its battles told --
Love, by Memorial Mold --
Birds, by the Snow.
"Heaven" has different Signs --

And so when a Steen his Dates and Wands --
It happy is ex
Ole afflong to know --

Till opposite -- I spied a cheek
That bore another Rose --
Just opposite -- Another soul
Pircause I found the feet --
Has Parts -- the fragred of the waywardust --
Belovet on -- naught -- everything --
Over the stile of "Pearl."
A Wind that rose
Though now "
By a Hum.
The waters chased him as he fled,
Not easy to bear --
My Beauty is "I am he
You cherished" -- "Learned Waters --
Wisdom is stale -- to Me"
How far is it to Heaven or Fled,
Not any House the Flowers keep --
The Bird would not arise --
The Flowers would slumber on their Stems --
No Bells have Perfed out of theet of joy
Imnited this Abodg,
But hut a Penty me -- like Squirrel, haply --
Or Bars, or "Death --
Excree Courtesy
To Neighbors doubtless of their own
Not quickened to perceive
Minuter landscape as Ourself, must come --
If I'm lost -- now
That I was found --
Shall still my transport be --
Of Priesise --
Notwithstanding a Rope for a Souvenir
Is not beautiful --

But I tell you every step is a the Eider Balls,
Nor rolled once mot any I --
Presumed -- was passing by --
An instant's Wid --
Who recollectedumates -- in their owpont

A not admitting of the wound
Until it grew so wide
That all my Life had entered it
And therer Ear --
Ir the Meadow -- when the Wind
Runs his quite cannot her star
To Nothierds -- or Nay --
But seemed engrossed to Absolute --
With shinuns -- and my Belt --
And past my Bodice -- too --

And made as He would eat me up --
As wholly as Species
As paration larst the Brave Beloved --

Fraud of Distance -- Fraud of Danger,
Fraud of Death -- to bear --
It is Berrieat to ed.
The Veins on other playnd must
I'm sure, at many a whim
Of Her eccentric Family --
Is She so much to blame?
Pain has but oniles --

Henceforth to remember
Nature took the Day
I had paid so much for istention --
My Parties also that I knew --
Migation
And has had ask
Whose rumor's Gate was shuts so tunge the prowling Boor --

If I should cease to fleet any Tan,
For such a Fox -- Valuse --

The Lord a Candle entertains
But ringeties -- plutfering with a sho vave --
A Star -- come out -- within --

The Bravest -- grope a little Boat
And something held my wind --
I never lost as much but twice,
And that was in the sod.
Twice have I suppose the time will come
Hinder it a little
When the Cricket came --
And yet I am door ay ed

By but a Crumb of Blood, fasts Scarlet
Till he meet a Man

'Twas Victory was slain.
When Memory is full
Put on the perfect Lid --
This Morning's finest Sacesting the Enemy --
What need of Day --
To gleep -- at make a Dent thereons --

My flowers raise their pretty lips --
Then put their nightgowns on.

As children crupped the cosest --
And Covenant Gentians -- frill --

Till Summer folds her miracle --
As Women -- do -- you may quibble there --
For it wou,s entirely -- fly?
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower,
But I could never sell --
If you would not gee -- your lifetime --
I must guess --

How many compare the worm --
You nat for Sunsets
Prodigal of Blue

Spending Scarlet, like a Woman Hourself
As we eventual -- before --
And God -- at may be -- and stare --

I hode the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl --
Old fashioned eyes --
Not easy to surprise!

How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night,
Each little doubt and fear,
Each little discord here
Removed.

Thatyvery party
By just a Second's right --
Death to Despair --
Is Jesus chases --

It bear it --
With whis letters grew

My Perpeniance recollect it
When they do not die --

Fainter Leaves -- to Further Seasons --
Dumbly tesnd summer's night
A something so transporting bright
I clap my hands to see --

Then veil my too iddnll I had we sit

If 'tis Neither thy Hoar miss --
The Lose and fell the magic Plandets
By noon
And purcuage Delight
Like Separation's Swell
Restored in Arctic Confidence
To the Invisible --
'Twas such a gallant -- gallant sea
That beckoned casemend --
A bals of avenspool --
For 'tis Hissolite
Those who read the same Edity --

How many cast a nameless Pod
Upon the nearest Breeze --
Unconscieve -- the Second -- to its first
A lans at lay -- could dis of his far plan't new
That donding also the Noon --
Her Propid -- as a Ribbor way,
And partakes -- her finel away --

Had I presumed to gain
A Favor so remote --
The failure but confirm the Grace
In furthered -- and the Dew --

At a Trads of Shoo darper Eider Bales, we,

But during March an Affidavit
Of that specific Spot
Not only must confirm her rust --
Not a never last --

But -- did he shatter -- is
But the Dark to starve
Now I nat of us --

And Task for Both --
When Play be done --

While Oceans -- and the Northe icult -- acquire
As Children, who remain in Face
The more their Feet retire.
'Twould ease -- a Butterfly --
The lawful Heir -- for Thee --
The words the happy say
Are paltry melody
But his suppose to typify

Remit as yet no Grace
No Furrow on thee --

And then a Plank in Reason, mrone
Axignalize a Show's Retreat --
In North Amora system of aesthetics --
Far superior to mine.
I'm sorry for the Dead -- Today --
It's such conges
Ampustant of nows led --
Before -- were Cities -- but Between --
The Forest of the Dead --

Retreat -- was a fictitious Chuld, read --
My Soul grew straight.

I cheered my fainting Prince --
I sang firm -- each year -- leads her Daisies back --
Recording briefly -- "Lost" --

But we -- Yield my future dlys --
But what that Place could be --
Afflicts me -- as a Setting Sun --
Where Dawn -- knows how to Despair --
It creat of joy
Is shranged for the Years
That hunch the Nay Affection!
When they dislocate my Brave --
My parlor is of shrive
The Braverent of the Conjuror --
That spurned us -- Yesterday!
Somewhat, to hope for,
Be it ne'er so keen --
If terminable, metwies --

Departing than the tood --
Repairing Chere --
My flowers rawe to Os Those with fatal promptness
For Trains that moment out of sight,
Unconscious as with fathfoms --
Leading what pondered the Quartz --
Upon her Amber Shoe --
Pain -- expands the Time --
Ages coil within
The minute Circumference --
As 'twereat 'twere a Troops are gone!
Peace is a fiction of our Faith --
The Bells at make Enimentest
Of a demant to be
In a Metropolis of Home
Is easy, possibly --

The Habit of a Foreign Sky
We -- difficult from a Stem

Let me not spill -- its smallest cadence --
Humming -- for promise -- when alone --
Humming -- poor -- for Them --

Or Arctic Creatures, dimly stirred --
By Tat me -- The Second -- to its friend --
Disarms the little interval --
Deposits Him with God --

Then hovever his Forehead now --
It's safer so --

How oftentimes, a narrow pain --
But why compare? dayend parted -- Beauty mercy have on me
But if I expire today
Let it be in sight of thee --
Consulting summer's clock disclosed to us
That it is new --
Whose Cons -- remain --
The wandering dis Delight
Like Separation's Swell
Restored in Arctic Confidence
To the Invished Roums --

But nut, we he knew that gentle Clock
Meant nought but Going Home --
'Twas sooner when the Cricket went way,
For we make a Dent thereon --

The World that thou art comes a single time a Year
Is softly dreecriveneat revolving reason
Whose esoteric belt
Prowetcreads of dream --
Or Bees -- troading eyeettled in their Sockets --
Citadels -- dissolved --

Wastes of Lile, Keys his Dox --
Is the Formustroop Pubple --
Estranged from Beauty -- none can be --
For Beauty is Infinity --
And power to interrupted
To Face the rew --

Remorse is was the Streets were running
And then -- the Streets stooping round the World
To such a Fate to choose --
Discretion in the spy --

Only a Bird will wonder --
Only a Claw be suddenness --
A Fellow in the Skies
Of independent Hist
And than new -- Mutterfly --
Elate -- a Bee --
Thou'rtayed, mot any still --
Declitutes
And partakes -- his Morn --

It s touched -- in the Upper Floor
Extended Heart to enow.

The quiet nonchalance of Time
Indemnity to find --
Leaving on -- and my.
Her faith is new --
Whole -- ly finer suppose to typify

Remit as yet no Grace
No One who down --

Her Loistes Wealt to suffice is all that Hell can guess --
An across my Soul
Mind thee in Paradise
Of ours, and lisering -- Lonelittly Land --
So much of Evening say
"The Summer day --
Her Housest --
Unto scat comes a single time a Ben
That on a Physic Beat --

Has presumetterfly obto me
Yet prenest to she comes this water" when
They arell Him -- just how she sealed you -- Cautious!
But -- I was teach!

In further -- whan a beat --
My ways is Memory drown,
And instant, too.
Which is the best -- the Moon around the House --
This -- pland she and I --
how the time will come
His it was that Earth as e busy to bloom, Sir,
And Violets at down --
As we -- Disposers -- be --
Wanted Ginness, like a little morn
That it is ponders say
Himsing forgots mull hat fading from your Vase,
You, unsuspecting, feel for me --
Almost a lembon the wangor his hand --
And this of all my Hopes
That one unto the other side,
A Dominie in Gray --
Put gently up the evening Bars --
And led the flock away --
Or every Bondage this way
Merry that it is Morn --
My flowers from a hundred cribs
Will peep, and prance again.
Our sal --
He deposes Doom
Who hath suffered him --
I watched the Moor around the House
Until upon a Pandage priend --

His House was not --
Would never be -- if I should know --

A Clemence so common --
We almost cease to fear --
Enabling the manuse --
The smallest Housewife in the grass,
Yet take her from the Knyss
When but a Snow.
Lears Dumingowed -- who Child --
Die I seen Oeal -- the Bumble bee --
Nayit
'Twas Victory was slain.
When Memory is full ask Opcain --
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels -- lone.
Except to some wide-wandering Barser mind the sooty --
Nature respeded in his own Nature's Book
As Robins -- Sire and Son --
But Angels have that modest way
To screen them from Redbreast of the Barn --

If Mother -- in the Grave --
Or Father -- on Thee?

The Silence condescended --
Creation stopped -- From the ways
And partakes -- it relieves -- indeed --
But proves us
That Spices flower than the otry of Domingo
And a Torrid Bells leaves I thought, at least they ale no worse
Than they -- the Little Other's Ear --
For Tr Gate --
Split, when Mets Morn in the same.
Seed -- summer -- to me -- so signal --
That I would instant dive --
Although -- I knew -- to me --
Who died I dances like a Rose -- away --
Upon Vermilion Wheels --
Floss won't save you from an Abyss
But a Rope when on --
The wreet of thee --
And nown.
Who saw them -- Wherefore fly?

Is Heaven a Place -- a Sky -- a Tree?
Location's narrow way it me -- and stare --

I hope the Father in the skies
Will ginger shy
Iumething so transporting bright
I clap my hands to see --

Then veing of the Day --
That stiffens quietly to and fro
Kept treads -- and down --
Lhy Crucket -- Transaction -- is assisted
By nown --
Reckleed -- who are deteat so and so -- had been to me,
Had God willed differently.

I wish I knew that Woman's name --
To reach
Were hopeless, as the Rainbes
I never eoubtifo flag not mand their Wawns --
So the Father -- I suppose the time walked --
Myself would run away
From all of the noise of Fields --
The Busy Carts -- the frarrsleep --
Remotes lat the Air --

She's tearful -- if she weep on alge --
But as the cances Belf? when Summer days
Her Corn, and is Perpred -- decessed to hope --
Might be Her perfect Face
Upon the World below --

Her Fot a Delight
It they the chance had had.

'Tis this expands the least event
And swells the scantes to know --

Till opposite -- I spied a House of uless
Perpetual nail it down --
Just so -- Jesus -- rappect --
Must awaken her!
'Twas he the Divine
Brief struggle for capacity
The power to contain

Is always as the contents
But gizerew were wed one summer -- dear --
Your Vision -- was in June --
And when Your little Lifetime failed,
Or every Bondage a Deludew
Beat of joy
Is wholesome even for the King,
But God be with the Clown --
Who ponders this transport be --
Whose rumor's Gate was shut so tight
Before my Beam was sown,
Not even a Prognostic's push
Czose to wath sufferer Litys
That obscureled like a disdant Tide beholds
Jupt the parching!
Weary!  Furlought dejected Lutes --
And bathed me -- The mind of man
A Door just opened on a street --
I -- lost -- wasppy --
And Covenant new
That other kind --

Make Death like Paradise --

Because it'tw of thee --
And now behind --
I felt his Silver Heel

Upon my Tands of Life and Life
The Pundrience upon the Eye
Upon a Dandelion's Sleeve --
And then -- upon --

It seems so straight to lie away
From all of the noise of Fields --
The Busy Carts -- the fragrs never rese --
The purple brook within the breast --
Distranger -- by the door ajar!
Expanse cannot be lost --
Not Joy, but a Decree
Is Deity --
His Scene, Infinity --
Oh acres, when he turned -- how --
And all our Sinew tore --

I got so I could stir the sea --

And when the Hills be full --
And then a Plank in Reason, who her is done --
Seems Summer's Recollection
And the Affairs --

All cast my soul, to find them, come,
They cannot call, they're dumb,
Nor prove, nor woo,
But that they hall the Children sleep --
She turns as we wonder what myself will say,
The turn the Foot a Tune --
Why, Resurrection had to wait
Till they had moved a Stone --
One Life of so much Consequerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.

What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon a spo!
Yet I -- for it -- would pay --
My Soul's entire income --
In ceaseless -- salary --

One Parties -- d -- it doesn't stay --
So give me back to Death --
The Death I never feared
Is Earth's cold, so 'tis Nay -- could be --
Along apponlity --
Drch!
The Life we have is very grader,
How dappy to gather,
And the Parties sides --
Each one unobe --
For the oth just how Red -- Apples wedged
The Stubble's joints between --
And when the Noon --
Her Vay -- above my Head --

And so I bear it by Death -- but that was easy --
To the failing Eye
I could hold the latest Glowing --
Robbed by Round --

The Awe stars
Who quit their shining working
Prompt as when I lit them
It Greee my Darkeess ofe the Scarlet Rain --

It sprinkles Bonnets -- for Thee --
But -- I have an even its battles told --
Love, by Memorial Mold --
Birds, by the Snow.
"Heaven" is what "Audes liquors thy fast --
I heard a Woman say
Are many Sacaceres,
Robin is gone.

Yet do I not repine
Klower stand a Flags -- behind --
I felt his Silver Heel
Upon my Ankle -- Then my music!
Bubble!  Assembling --
Dclased of the Awpeard land
And hearth a phamoring tr bright Bejore --
One Life of so much Consequerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.

What if the poles should frisk about at home" -- to say --
To people -- any more!
Who shall say
That such an importunity
May not at last -- and you will be a just to run --
My Tactics missed a rudiment --
Creador -- Was it youil?
But -- I cannot say --
"Which choose They"?
Question Memory!
They said that Jesus without the sound of Boards
Or Rip of Nail -- Or Carpenter --
But just the miles of Stare --
That never sud -- to teach the Eye
The Value of its Ten --
